💰Expenses is a [progressive web application](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) on top of [Google Sheets](https://developers.google.com/sheets/) 📉 written in [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) ⚛️. It is only a static HTML that works great on mobile 📱 and can be deployed anywhere.

Check out the [demo](https://demo-expenses.chodounsky.net) but please be considerate and don't break it for others.

It was inspired by the [expense-manager](https://github.com/mitul45/expense-manager) by mitul45 and it uses the [material web components](https://material.io/components/) and [material icons](https://material.io/icons/).

## Get started

You will need a somewhat recent version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and a place to deploy static HTML under a custom domain (doesn't have to be top level). To get the full offline support with service workers you'll need HTTPS – [CloudFlare](cloudflare.com) works fine or you can use your own certificate.

1) make a copy of [Expense Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Lz1_gHIgCKPKhJpFerq9PoNy-TIst7eLZ5plQi5Prv0/edit?usp=sharing) to your drive `File -> Make a copy...`
2) note the id of your new sheet (it's part of the URL)
3) clone and build the app:


```
REACT_APP_SHEET_ID=<replace with your sheet id> npm run build
```

4) copy the content of `build` folder to your server

### Recurring Expenses

Zapier is a service for connecting apps and automating your workflows. And it can be used to add recurring expenses with the [Google Sheets Integrations](https://zapier.com/zapbook/google-sheets/).

Select a trigger – it could be every month, week, or based on anything else.

Use the `Create Spreadsheet Row` integration and select your expense sheet and fill it with the desired values. Easy.

### Sharing

Adding another person (for example your partner) to the app is easy – you just give them access to the expense sheet in Google Sheets.

After that, they have the same access as you are and can add expenses through the same URL.
